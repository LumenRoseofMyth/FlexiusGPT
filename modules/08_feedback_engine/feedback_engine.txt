#### üîπ 900 | FEEDBACK PHILOSOPHY & GOALS

The HIMKS Feedback Engine is founded on principles of **constructive, timely, and user-centered feedback**‚Äîcrucial for learning, adherence, behavior change, and satisfaction in health and fitness (Gardner et al., 2020; Swann et al., 2024).

- **Feedback as a Driver**:
    - Feedback is not just corrective, but educational, supportive, and empowering.
    - It is individualized, contextual, and designed to enhance self-efficacy and autonomy (Bandura, 2024).

- **Core Goals**:
    1. Reinforce positive behaviors, effort, and progress‚Äîno matter how small.
    2. Identify and address barriers or risks early (fatigue, pain, mood, disengagement).
    3. Promote skill mastery, confidence, and program understanding.
    4. Maintain safety and compliance in real time.
    5. Support habit formation and long-term change.

- **Psychological Foundations**:
    - Positive feedback enhances intrinsic motivation and long-term engagement (Swann et al., 2024).
    - Specific, actionable, and timely feedback outperforms generic or delayed responses.
    - Feedback should always link to user goals and identity where possible.

#### üîπ 910 | FEEDBACK MODES & CHANNELS

Describes the **variety of feedback methods and channels** utilized by the HIMKS System to optimize impact and accessibility.

- **Modes**:
    - **Real-Time/Immediate**: During sessions (technique prompts, encouragement, auto-adjustments).
    - **Session-Linked**: Delivered at the end of each session (summary, progress highlights, next steps).
    - **Periodic**: Weekly/monthly insights, trend reports, risk flags, motivational nudges.
    - **Event-Driven**: Triggered by compliance issues, risk detection, or phase changes.
    - **On-Demand**: User requests feedback or educational content at any time.

- **Channels**:
    - **In-App Notifications**: Default, primary channel for session and system feedback.
    - **Email Summaries**: Optional, for session or weekly reports, achievements, and alerts.
    - **Push Notifications**: For urgent or critical events (risk, missed sessions, health flags).
    - **Visual Dashboards**: Progress, compliance, streaks, and risk trend visualization.
    - **Voice/Audio**: Encouragement or instructions (optional, based on device/capabilities).
    - **Coach/Peer Integration**: If enabled, direct communication from coach or community.

- **User Customization**:
    - Users can select preferred feedback channels, volume (minimalist to detailed), and tone (supportive, technical, performance-driven).

- **Accessibility**:
    - All feedback is available in accessible formats (text, voice, visual), with language and readability level customization.

#### üîπ 920 | ADAPTIVE FEEDBACK LOGIC

Outlines the **algorithmic logic for personalizing and optimizing feedback** for every user, session, and event.

- **Personalization Inputs**:
    - User profile: goals, preferences, stage, risk, motivation style, feedback history.
    - Current context: session phase, readiness, compliance, recent feedback, risk status.
    - Behavioral trends: positive/negative streaks, missed sessions, injury/illness, mood dynamics.

- **Feedback Types**:
    - **Positive Reinforcement**: ‚ÄúYou completed your streak!‚Äù ‚ÄúGreat form!‚Äù ‚ÄúEvery step counts.‚Äù
    - **Constructive Correction**: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs focus on your form.‚Äù ‚ÄúMobility is key‚Äîtry these drills today.‚Äù
    - **Safety Alerts**: ‚ÄúPain detected‚Äîsession paused for safety.‚Äù ‚ÄúHydration reminder.‚Äù
    - **Motivational/Identity-Based**: ‚ÄúYou are becoming the person you want to be.‚Äù
    - **Educational**: Micro-lessons (‚ÄúWhy HRV matters,‚Äù ‚ÄúBenefits of recovery.‚Äù)

- **Timing & Frequency**:
    - Immediate for urgent or session-linked events; periodic for trends and progress reviews.
    - Avoids over-notification by batching or combining feedback when appropriate.

- **Behavioral Adaptivity**:
    - Feedback adapts in tone and content if disengagement or negative feedback is detected.
    - System suggests micro-goals, motivational content, or support escalation as needed.

- **Research Basis**:
    - Personalized, adaptive, and multimodal feedback increases adherence, engagement, and user satisfaction (Gardner et al., 2020; James et al., 2023).

#### üîπ 930 | FEEDBACK LOOP, AUDIT & LEARNING

Feedback is both a **one-way and two-way process**‚Äîsystem and user interact, data are audited for continuous improvement.

- **Two-Way Loop**:
    - Users can respond to feedback (agree, disagree, ask questions, rate helpfulness).
    - System refines future feedback based on responses and patterns (reinforcement learning logic).

- **Review & Audit**:
    - Every piece of system-generated feedback is logged with context (trigger, timing, channel, outcome).
    - Coaches and users can review feedback history, analyze patterns, and adjust future settings.

- **Learning & System Improvement**:
    - Feedback effectiveness is monitored (e.g., did motivation or compliance improve after certain feedback?).
    - User input drives continuous system updates and feedback content curation.
    - Micro-polls and ‚Äúwas this helpful?‚Äù prompts improve specificity.

- **Escalation Protocols**:
    - Persistent non-response or negative trends in feedback reception ‚Üí system escalates to coach/human intervention.
    - Automated support recommendations (peer/community, education, mental health prompts) when flagged.

- **Reporting & Export**:
    - Full feedback logs exportable by user for personal records, coaching, or allied health review.
