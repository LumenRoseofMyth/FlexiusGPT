#### üîπ 2000 | CONTENT GOVERNANCE & EVIDENCE LOGIC

The HIMKS Content Update Engine is built to guarantee that **all system content is accurate, up-to-date, and context-appropriate** (Shojania et al., 2022).

- **Triggers**:
    - New high-impact research, consensus guidelines, or regulatory updates.
    - User or coach feedback identifying outdated, unclear, or harmful information.
    - System detection of knowledge gaps or FAQ trends.

#### üîπ 2020 | REVIEW, VERSIONING & TRANSPARENCY

Ensures **all content changes are transparent, auditable, and clearly communicated** to users and stakeholders.
