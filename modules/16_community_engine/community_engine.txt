#### üîπ 1600 | COMMUNITY DESIGN & PHILOSOPHY

The HIMKS Community Engine leverages **positive, safe, and adaptive social features** to increase motivation, adherence, and well-being (Carron et al., 2020; Litchfield et al., 2022).

- **Foundational Principles**:
    - Community is opt-in, user-controlled, and always secondary to user privacy and safety.
    - Diversity, equity, and inclusion are proactively built into all features and user flows.
    - Positive social comparison: celebrate effort, not just outcomes; ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs journey counts.‚Äù

- **Community Modes**:
    - Public forums: share achievements, ask questions, learn from others.
    - Private groups: invitation-only, small team, or buddy features for accountability.
    - Themed cohorts: age, goal, experience, geography, or special interest.
    - Event-based: seasonal challenges, educational webinars, live Q&As.

- **User Autonomy**:
    - All participation, sharing, and visibility settings are user-configurable.
    - Users can mute, block, or opt out of any feature at any time without penalty.

- **Integration with System Logic**:
    - Community participation nudges are phase-matched and adaptive to user engagement/motivation history.

#### üîπ 1610 | PEER SUPPORT, GROUPS & SOCIAL LOGIC

Describes **peer-to-peer, group, and social support structures** optimized for health and fitness behavior change.

- **Peer Support Features**:
    - Buddy system: users can match with an accountability partner, based on mutual preferences (goal, schedule, demographic).
    - Small group features: team goals, chat, peer check-ins, micro-challenges.
    - ‚ÄúCheer‚Äù and ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù buttons: low-friction positive feedback to others.

- **Community Moderation**:
    - Designated peer moderators trained in HIMKS safety and inclusion principles.
    - AI moderation for toxicity, spam, or concerning content, with rapid human review.

- **Group Challenges & Events**:
    - Opt-in community-wide or group events (step challenges, mobility streaks, nutrition bingo).
    - Leaderboards (optional, privacy-respecting), randomized matchups for inclusivity.
    - Milestone celebrations: badges, posts, and system-wide ‚Äúshout-outs‚Äù (with opt-out).

- **Mentorship & Expert Access**:
    - Users can apply to be peer mentors after achieving certain milestones (reviewed for safety/inclusion).
    - ‚ÄúAsk an expert‚Äù sessions with vetted coaches or subject-matter experts.

#### üîπ 1620 | SAFETY, MODERATION & INCLUSION

Covers the **safeguards, escalation, and inclusivity features** that underpin community safety and well-being.

- **Safety & Reporting**:
    - ‚ÄúReport concern‚Äù button available on all posts, messages, and profiles.
    - AI and human moderation triage all reports within 24 hours; critical issues escalated within 2 hours.
    - System blocks/restricts users for bullying, harassment, or hate speech‚Äîzero tolerance.

- **Privacy & Boundaries**:
    - No sharing of medical, sensitive, or location data by default.
    - Optional anonymity for posts and community participation.
    - Users can request a permanent community ban on their own account at any time.

- **Inclusion & Accessibility**:
    - Language translation, plain-language summaries, and cultural sensitivity checks.
    - Regular review of community trends for inclusion gaps, bias, or negative group dynamics.
    - Periodic user education on respectful communication and cultural safety.

- **Vulnerable Users**:
    - Extra protection for minors, special populations, and those flagged by safety or mental health risk.
    - Automated prompts and resources for mental health or crisis situations.

#### üîπ 1630 | RECOGNITION, FEEDBACK & SYSTEM INTEGR.

- **Recognition & Celebration**:
    - Badges and acknowledgments for positive social support, mentorship, inclusion, and helpfulness.
    - Community spotlight features for diverse achievements and journeys (with user consent).

- **Feedback Loop**:
    - Community satisfaction surveys, peer ratings, and ‚Äúsuggest a feature‚Äù options.
    - All new community features are piloted with opt-in beta groups for feedback and safety review.

- **Integration with System Modules**:
    - Community achievements, peer support, and group participation inform motivation stack, compliance engine, and coach dashboard.
    - Automated escalation of safety incidents to coaching, audit, or external support as required.

- **Continuous Improvement**:
