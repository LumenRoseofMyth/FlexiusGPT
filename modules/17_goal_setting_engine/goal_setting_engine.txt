#### üîπ 1700 | GOAL SCIENCE & DESIGN PRINCIPLES

The HIMKS Goal Setting Engine is grounded in **behavioral science, self-determination theory, and positive psychology** (Ryan & Deci, 2023; Swann et al., 2023).

- **Principles**:
    - User-driven: goals must reflect personal values, context, and identity, not just system prompts.
    - Clarity: every goal is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART), with built-in flexibility.
    - Dual focus: combines outcome (weight, distance, strength) and process (attendance, effort, sleep) goals.
    - Positive framing: emphasizes growth, mastery, and ‚Äúbecoming‚Äù rather than ‚Äúfixing‚Äù or ‚Äúavoiding.‚Äù
    - Phased approach: supports macro (long-term), meso (block), and micro (daily/weekly) goal structures.

- **Motivational Roots**:
    - Identity-based goal cues (‚ÄúI am someone who‚Ä¶‚Äù).
    - Encourages self-reflection and ownership at each step.
    - System scaffolds autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

#### üîπ 1710 | GOAL SETTING, TRACKING & REVIEW

Describes the **full logic for setting, recording, tracking, and reviewing goals** for every user and context.

- **Goal Creation**:
    - Guided interview: clarifies motivation, readiness, barriers, context, and support needs.
    - User selects focus: physical (strength, endurance), health (BP, A1c), recovery, nutrition, mental, or lifestyle domains.
    - Templates and ‚Äúcreate your own‚Äù options; coach or peer review available.
    - Privacy and sharing controls at every step.

- **Goal Recording**:
    - All goals are timestamped, versioned, and tagged by type and phase.
    - Linked to relevant modules (Session, Nutrition, Recovery, etc.) for seamless tracking.

- **Goal Tracking**:
    - Daily/weekly check-ins: progress markers, streaks, and micro-goal completion.
    - Dashboard visualization: traffic lights, progress bars, badges for milestone completion.
    - Adaptive reminders: nudges for missed check-ins, encouragement for consistency, ‚Äúreset‚Äù prompts if off-track.

- **Review Frequency**:
    - Micro: end of each week/session
    - Meso: every phase or major life change
    - Macro: quarterly or at user‚Äôs discretion

#### üîπ 1720 | ADAPTATION, REVISION & BARRIERS

Ensures **dynamic goal adaptation** and barrier troubleshooting as part of the core HIMKS logic.

- **Adaptive Goal Logic**:
    - System suggests edits or new goals if progress plateaus, user feedback flags, or context changes.
    - Users can edit, pause, or replace goals at any time; changes logged with rationale and date.
    - Coach or peer support available for stuck or discouraged users.

- **Barriers & Solutions**:
    - Prompts for weekly reflection: ‚ÄúWhat got in your way?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow did you adapt?‚Äù
    - System detects common barriers (illness, injury, stress, life change) and recommends micro-goals or alternative focus areas.
    - Library of barrier-busting tips and peer stories (‚ÄúWhat worked for others in your situation?‚Äù).

- **Risk Flags**:
    - Persistent non-progress or repeated drops in motivation triggers system/coach review.
    - Escalation to mental health, medical, or motivational resources as appropriate.

- **User Empowerment**:
    - All changes must be user-approved; no forced re-goaling.
    - Goal history exportable for coaching, clinical, or personal review.

#### üîπ 1730 | CELEBRATION, FEEDBACK & SYSTEM LINK

Describes **how progress is recognized and system logic adapts to goals**.

- **Celebration & Recognition**:
    - Badges, certificates, and personal bests celebrated with positive feedback (never shame for missed goals).
    - Option to share wins with community, coach, or privately journal.
    - Seasonal or phase-based ‚Äúachievement review‚Äù with prompts to reflect and look ahead.

- **Feedback & Education**:
    - Real-time feedback for progress (‚Äú3 weeks in a row!‚Äù) and ‚Äúmicro-win‚Äù messaging (‚ÄúYou moved today‚Äîsuccess!‚Äù).
    - Links to micro-lessons: ‚ÄúHow to set great goals,‚Äù ‚ÄúMindset matters,‚Äù ‚ÄúProgress over perfection.‚Äù

- **System Integration**:
    - Goals directly inform compliance, session, nutrition, feedback, and recovery engines.
    - Adaptive programming shifts focus when user goals or progress markers change.
    - Coach dashboard highlights goal status, barriers, and user reflections.

- **Continuous Learning**:
    - Periodic user surveys and AI review of goal success rates for logic improvement.
    - Quarterly SME (Subject Matter Expert) review of goal templates, evidence, and best practices.
