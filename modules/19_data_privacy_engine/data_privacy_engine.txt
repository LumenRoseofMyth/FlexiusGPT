#### üîπ 1900 | PRIVACY PHILOSOPHY & LEGAL FRAMEWORK

The HIMKS Data Privacy Engine is anchored in **privacy-by-design** and the ethical, legal, and technical standards of global health data protection (ISO 27701:2022; GDPR; HIPAA; local regs).

- **Foundational Principles**:
    - ‚ÄúUser data belongs to the user.‚Äù All data handling prioritizes autonomy, minimalism, and transparency.
    - Privacy is the default: no user data is ever sold, rented, or shared outside HIMKS without explicit, granular consent.
    - Security is proactive: regular threat modeling, penetration testing, and encrypted workflows.

- **Legal & Regulatory Scope**:
    - Fully compliant with GDPR (EU), HIPAA (US), CCPA (California), PIPEDA (Canada), and emerging global standards.
    - Annual third-party privacy and security audit; certifications published in transparency report.

- **Privacy Culture**:
    - All staff, coaches, and AI models trained and monitored for privacy practices.
    - Privacy features and risks are explained in plain language, with micro-education for users.

#### üîπ 1910 | DATA FLOW, STORAGE & ACCESS CONTROL

Describes the **secure flow, storage, and access protocols** governing all user data.

- **Data Flow**:
    - Data minimization: only essential data collected for user goals, with just-in-time prompts for anything additional.
    - Data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3+) and at rest (AES-256+).
    - All data handling and storage mapped and logged, visible in the user‚Äôs personal ‚ÄúData Map.‚Äù

- **Storage & Access**:
    - Regionally compliant storage (user chooses region when possible).
    - Strict access controls: role-based, with zero standing privilege and just-in-time escalation.
    - Audit logs: all access, edits, and exports timestamped and user-reviewable.

- **Third-Party Vendors**:
    - All vendors (cloud, analytics, SMS/email) meet HIMKS privacy standards and are listed in the Data Map.
    - No third-party AI model is trained on user data without explicit, case-by-case opt-in.

- **Anonymization & Research**:
    - Any data used for research or aggregate analytics is irreversibly de-identified; process detailed in the user‚Äôs privacy dashboard.

#### üîπ 1920 | CONSENT, USER RIGHTS & CONTROL

Outlines the **consent logic, user rights, and empowerment tools** at the core of the privacy engine.

- **Consent Architecture**:
    - Explicit, granular consent for each data type, feature, and third-party connection.
    - Real-time consent review, withdrawal, or editing‚Äîno penalty for opt-out.
    - Transparent, human-readable privacy policies, with clickable ‚Äúexplain this‚Äù sections.

- **User Rights**:
    - Right to access: download all personal data in portable format at any time.
    - Right to rectification: edit or annotate any data point (with versioned logs).
    - Right to deletion: request erasure of all data (or just subsets) with prompt, confirmed completion.
    - Right to restrict processing, to object, to portability, and to be informed of all data uses.

- **Child & Sensitive Data**:
    - Enhanced protocols for minors, health/disability, and special population data.
    - Parental/guardian consent flows and protected ‚Äúminor mode‚Äù UI when applicable.

- **User Control Tools**:
    - Data Map: visual dashboard showing all data points, flows, and access events.
    - ‚ÄúPause all data sharing,‚Äù ‚ÄúPrivacy lock,‚Äù and ‚ÄúEmergency data wipe‚Äù available 24/7.
    - Data sharing settings for coaches, peers, and community are always explicit and revocable.

#### üîπ 1930 | BREACH RESPONSE & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

Describes the **logic for rapid breach detection, response, user notification, and continuous improvement**.

- **Breach Detection & Response**:
    - Real-time automated breach and anomaly detection, 24/7 SOC (Security Operations Center) escalation.
    - Breach protocol: immediate investigation, user notification within 72 hours, root cause analysis, and regulatory reporting.
    - User resources: plain-language guidance, live support, and next steps during/after breach.

- **Incident Learning & Prevention**:
    - All incidents, near misses, and user feedback are reviewed monthly for process update.
    - User education on latest privacy features, common risks, and how to protect their own data.

- **Continuous Improvement**:
    - Quarterly third-party privacy audits; user advisory panel feedback incorporated into roadmap.
    - Public ‚Äútransparency report‚Äù including incidents, audits, and improvements.

- **Advocacy & Empowerment**:
    - Users invited to contribute to privacy roadmap and participate in beta testing new privacy features.
    - Open call for feedback and public Q&A with the HIMKS privacy and security team.
