#### üîπ 1100 | NUTRITION PHILOSOPHY & GUIDING PRINCIPLES

The HIMKS Nutrition Engine is grounded in the belief that **nutrition is foundational to health, adaptation, and performance**. Nutrition support is accessible, personalized, safe, and culturally sensitive.

- **Guiding Principles**:
    - Whole food, minimally processed, balanced nutrition is promoted for all users (WHO, 2022).
    - Nutrition supports not just body composition but recovery, cognition, immunity, and mental well-being.
    - Education, not prescriptive diets: Focus on user empowerment and autonomy (Spronk et al., 2022).
    - No ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù: Plans respect age, sex, culture, ethics, health, phase, and personal goals.

- **Evidence Base**:
    - All nutrition guidance is based on global consensus, updated meta-analyses, and guidelines from WHO, ACSM, ISSN, and relevant authorities.
    - Nutrition logic is reviewed annually and with every major guideline update.

- **Safety First**:
    - Red-flag triggers for eating disorders, rapid weight loss, food intolerances, allergies, or special populations (e.g., pregnancy, chronic illness).
    - Encourages referral to registered dietitians/nutrition professionals as needed.

#### üîπ 1110 | ASSESSMENT, MONITORING & DATA INPUT

Robust assessment ensures all recommendations are **safe, appropriate, and user-centered**.

- **Initial Assessment**:
    - Medical and dietary history, allergies, intolerances, ethical/religious restrictions.
    - Anthropometrics: height, weight, body comp (if available), age, sex.
    - Lifestyle: work patterns, family eating, food access, cooking skills, budget.
    - Current nutrition tracking (if user consents): macro/micronutrient intake, hydration, supplements.

- **Ongoing Monitoring**:
    - Simple daily/weekly check-ins on energy, appetite, digestion, sleep, recovery, mood.
    - Optional detailed food diary/logging (with AI-driven feedback and no shaming).
    - Periodic re-assessment at major phase changes or user request.

- **Biofeedback Integration**:
    - Sleep, HRV, energy, and training recovery data linked to adaptive nutrition prompts (e.g., higher carb intake after HIIT, extra fluids in heat).

- **Data Privacy & Consent**:
    - All nutrition data is user-controlled, encrypted, and never shared outside HIMKS without explicit permission.

#### üîπ 1120 | PERSONALIZATION, ADAPTATION & RISK

The Nutrition Engine **dynamically adapts all recommendations** in real time, based on the user's phase, profile, goals, and risks.

- **Energy & Macro Distribution**:
    - Baseline estimated using validated equations (Mifflin-St Jeor, Harris-Benedict, WHO).
    - Macros (protein, carb, fat) are phase- and goal-matched: higher protein for strength/recovery, higher carbs for endurance/HIIT, moderate fat for hormonal health.
    - Flexible for low-carb, plant-based, or cultural diets, with auto-adaptive guidance.

- **Micronutrient Attention**:
    - Highlights iron, vitamin D, calcium, B12, omega-3, magnesium, zinc‚Äîadapting to user group (e.g., women, vegans, older adults).
    - Red-flag for common deficiencies and risk-based prompts for bloodwork (referral to MD/registered dietitian as needed).

- **Hydration Logic**:
    - Hydration targets based on weight, climate, exercise, and phase (Sawka, 2023).
    - AI reminders for fluid intake, especially in high sweat/heat or illness.

- **Special Populations**:
    - Pregnancy, youth, elderly, chronic disease, athletes, and those with eating disorder risk receive tailored protocols or prompts for professional guidance.
    - Allergy/intolerance database triggers recipe/substitution logic.

- **Risk Controls**:
    - Fast/unsafe weight change (>1%/week), recurring GI distress, or flagged disordered eating triggers a temporary pause and referral protocol.
    - Manual override only with ‚Äúrisk acknowledgment‚Äù and education provided.

#### üîπ 1130 | EDUCATION, FEEDBACK & SYSTEM INTEGRATION

Continuous **education and feedback** ensure users build nutrition literacy and lifelong healthy habits.

- **Just-in-Time Education**:
    - Micro-lessons: ‚ÄúHow to balance your plate,‚Äù ‚ÄúSmart snacking,‚Äù ‚ÄúPost-workout recovery nutrition.‚Äù
    - Debunking myths, busting fads, encouraging critical thinking about diet trends.

- **Behavioral Nudges**:
    - Positive reinforcement for healthy choices, new habits, and compliance streaks.
    - Identity-based and motivational messaging: ‚ÄúYou fuel like an athlete,‚Äù ‚ÄúSmall changes, big impact.‚Äù

- **Personalized Feedback**:
    - Automated, phase-relevant nudges: ‚ÄúRecovery week? Emphasize protein and hydration.‚Äù
    - Recipe suggestions, shopping lists, meal prep guides (matched to dietary profile, budget, skill).

- **System Integration**:
    - Nutrition status/flags inform and are informed by Compliance_Engine, Recovery_Stack, Adaptive_Programmer, Session_Engine.
    - Coaches can access user nutrition history and system recommendations for deeper personalization.

- **User Autonomy**:
    - All plans are editable, feedback is two-way, and users may opt out or customize any feature.
    - Self-reporting is celebrated, not penalized; feedback is always supportive.

- **Export & Professional Referral**:
    - Users may export nutrition logs for allied health, or request referral to a registered dietitian.
