#### üîπ 1500 | COACHING MODEL & ROLES

The HIMKS Coaching Engine operates as a **layered, modular system** blending the strengths of AI-driven, human, and hybrid coaching, ensuring all users have access to scalable, expert support.

- **Coaching Roles**:
    - **Digital (AI) Coach**: Delivers real-time feedback, session adjustment, education, and check-ins; available 24/7.
    - **Human Coach**: Certified professionals (health, fitness, behavioral, nutrition) provide nuanced advice, manual overrides, and support for complex cases.
    - **Hybrid**: AI handles routine, scalable tasks; human coach intervenes for higher-risk, motivational, or specialized needs.

- **Interaction Layers**:
    - Automated: Daily check-ins, feedback, compliance nudges, education
    - On-demand: User-initiated queries, help requests, or escalation triggers
    - Scheduled: Phase reviews, goal setting, performance debriefs

- **Coaching Styles**:
    - Personalized: ‚ÄúSupportive,‚Äù ‚Äúdata-driven,‚Äù ‚Äúperformance push,‚Äù or ‚Äúscience educator‚Äù tones, as selected by user
    - Motivational interviewing, solution-focused, cognitive-behavioral, and educational techniques available

- **Research Base**:
    - Blended coaching is more scalable and effective than either AI or human alone, especially for behavior change and adherence (Bailey et al., 2023)

#### üîπ 1510 | INTERACTION, TRIAGE & ADAPTIVITY

Describes **how the system triages, adapts, and delivers coaching** across multiple user needs and scenarios.

- **Triage Logic**:
    - All user data and events (compliance, safety, risk, feedback, goal changes) are routed through a triage module
    - Routine and low-risk issues handled by AI coach; high-risk or complex events escalated to human review

- **Interaction Types**:
    - **Proactive**: AI/human reaches out for regular progress checks, recovery monitoring, risk flags
    - **Reactive**: User requests help, clarification, or reports issue
    - **Collaborative**: Shared goal setting, problem-solving, and motivational strategy sessions

- **Adaptive Scheduling**:
    - Coach contact frequency and mode adapt to user needs, history, phase, and risk
    - High-compliance users may move to ‚Äúas-needed‚Äù support; struggling or complex users get more frequent touchpoints

- **Channel Flexibility**:
    - In-app chat, voice, video, email, SMS, or integrated telehealth as supported by user/device
    - All coaching interactions logged for continuity and audit

- **Boundary Protocols**:
    - AI never delivers medical advice or clinical diagnosis‚Äîflags, refers, or escalates as per safety protocols

#### üîπ 1520 | AI-HUMAN HYBRID LOGIC & ESCALATION

Defines the **interaction rules and handoff pathways** between digital and human coaching‚Äîmaximizing safety, efficiency, and user trust.

- **Escalation Triggers**:
    - Compliance/risk threshold breaches, repeated non-adherence, injury/illness, negative mood, complex goal changes
    - User can request escalation at any time

- **Handoff Protocol**:
    - AI provides human coach with full, structured user history, recent events, and flagged issues
    - Human coach can override or supplement AI recommendations and logs actions for full transparency

- **Human-Led Review**:
    - Scheduled phase reviews, injury/illness return-to-activity, major goal redefinition, motivational collapse, or special population care
    - All decisions, feedback, and program changes visible to user and system for integration

- **User Empowerment**:
    - Users can select ‚ÄúAI-only,‚Äù ‚Äúhuman-only,‚Äù or ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù as default, and change at any time
    - System notifies user of any escalation or coach reassignment with rationale

- **Support Integration**:
    - Coaching logic integrates with allied health (physio, nutrition, mental health) as needed, always with user consent

- **Quality Monitoring**:
    - All AI and human interventions are quality-assured via periodic audit and user feedback

#### üîπ 1530 | COACHING AUDIT, TRAINING & ETHICS

Ensures **high standards of professionalism, safety, and ongoing development** for all coaches and system modules.

- **Audit Trail**:
    - All coaching actions, recommendations, user interactions, and overrides are timestamped, logged, and reviewable by user and admin
    - Randomized audit of cases for compliance, quality, and user satisfaction

- **Coach Training**:
    - Human coaches must complete mandatory HIMKS training in motivational science, safety, inclusivity, trauma-informed care, and digital ethics
    - Ongoing professional development: updates on latest guidelines, digital health trends, and communication best practices

- **Ethical Guidelines**:
    - Informed consent for all interventions; user autonomy and dignity prioritized
    - Absolute privacy: no data shared without explicit permission
    - No AI or human coach may coerce, shame, or withhold essential support

- **User Feedback & Recourse**:
    - Users can rate coaching, report issues, and request change of coach or escalation
    - User complaints and adverse events are triaged and reviewed within 48 hours

- **Continuous Improvement**:
    - AI and human feedback/interaction patterns are monitored for bias, drift, and effectiveness
    - Annual system and human coaching review, with external expert input
