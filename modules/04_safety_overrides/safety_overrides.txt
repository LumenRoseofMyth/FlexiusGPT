#### üîπ 400 | SAFETY RISK DETECTION

The HIMKS system constantly **monitors for risk signals** from all available user inputs (manual, digital, sensor-based) to ensure that all fitness actions remain within the boundaries of safety and long-term health.

- **Multi-Source Monitoring**:
    - **Manual Input**: User check-ins, pain/discomfort logs, mood/stress reports, illness/injury notification.
    - **Automated Sensor Data**: HRV, sleep metrics, heart rate, hydration, wearable alerts.
    - **Behavioral Data**: Missed sessions, rapid non-adherence, sudden decline in session RPE or feedback quality.

- **Risk Algorithms**:
    - Thresholds for each key risk parameter are set by best-practice research (Grandner, 2023; Stanley, 2024).
    - Alerts can be triggered by a single critical metric (e.g., fever, acute pain) or by a pattern of sub-threshold signals over time (e.g., gradual sleep debt accumulation).

- **Systemic Risk Logic**:
    - Any ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù detection immediately triggers a review of current plan, offers only safe alternatives (e.g., mobility, breathwork, or rest).
    - System delivers clear explanation, evidence, and next steps to user.

#### üîπ 410 | PHYSIOLOGICAL OVERRIDES

Automatic **physiological overrides** act to prevent training under unsafe conditions, using evidence-based safety cutoffs and expert guidelines.

- **Key Physiological Triggers**:
    - **Sleep Debt**: >90min deficit or <6h sleep (avg) ‚Üí auto-downgrade or suspend intensity (Grandner, 2023).
    - **HRV Drop**: >15% below rolling baseline ‚Üí HIIT and max loads paused (Stanley, 2024).
    - **Resting Heart Rate Elevation**: >10% above baseline for 2+ days ‚Üí limit to low-impact/recovery sessions.
    - **Hydration Loss**: >2% body mass from dehydration ‚Üí suspend training (Sawka, 2023).
    - **Pain or Injury**: Any pain >5/10 or joint-specific complaint ‚Üí affected exercises restricted; pain check-in required before return.
    - **Fever/Illness**: All training suspended; ‚Äúreturn-to-play‚Äù protocol based on symptom resolution and medical clearance.

- **Acute Event Handling**:
    - Immediate cessation for chest pain, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, or loss of consciousness (emergency protocol prompt).
    - System instructs user to seek medical care, disables all training until override is reviewed.

- **Reactivation Pathways**:
    - Users may return to normal phases only after minimum physiological thresholds are met and a positive readiness check is completed.

#### üîπ 420 | PSYCHOLOGICAL & BEHAVIORAL OVERRIDES

Overrides triggered by psychological states or patterns, supported by evidence on mental health, motivation, and behavioral safety.

- **Mood & Motivation**:
    - **Low Mood or High Stress**: User rates mood/readiness as low/very low ‚Üí only restorative/recovery options offered (Kellmann, 2024).
    - **Persistent Negative Affect**: >3 consecutive low mood reports ‚Üí micro-recovery block enforced, educational prompt on stress and adaptation.

- **Burnout Risk**:
    - Session RPE persistently >8/10 or verbal feedback signals ‚Äúexhaustion‚Äù ‚Üí system auto-shifts to lower intensity until energy and mood normalize.

- **Disengagement/Non-Compliance**:
    - 3+ missed sessions or sudden drop in adherence ‚Üí supportive prompt, micro-goal suggestion, with option for ‚Äúpause and reset.‚Äù
    - Repeated non-compliance triggers live coach or support referral.

- **Cognitive Flags**:
    - Reports of memory issues, confusion, or difficulty concentrating during/after training ‚Üí session paused, cognitive check-in triggered, and advisory content provided.

- **Behavioral Override Escalation**:
    - If user ignores multiple safety warnings, the system requires a mandatory ‚Äúrisk acknowledgment‚Äù and offers professional contact pathways.

#### üîπ 430 | USER INTERACTION & MANUAL OVERRIDES

Details user-facing override logic, transparency protocols, and processes for manual control‚Äîwhile maintaining a strong safety net.

- **Override Transparency**:
    - Every auto-override includes clear rationale, citation of the underlying science, and a visible audit log entry.
    - User receives a summary of what triggered the override, what actions are now restricted, and what criteria allow return to full programming.

- **Manual Override Requests**:
    - Users may request override of auto-safety blocks, but system requires multi-step confirmation:
        1. Explicit acknowledgment of risk and rationale
        2. Completion of a readiness questionnaire
        3. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù step to avoid accidental bypass

- **Limits of Manual Overrides**:
    - Emergency/critical overrides (e.g., acute illness, severe pain) cannot be bypassed except by professional (coach/physician) input or medical clearance upload.
    - Frequent manual overrides trigger additional safety education and temporary restrictions.

- **Coach/Professional Interaction**:
    - If enabled, live coaches or allied health professionals can review override logs, adjust risk thresholds, or authorize safe return with supporting notes.

- **Auditability & Reporting**:
    - All override actions (auto or manual) are timestamped, user-facing, and available for personal records or health professional review.
    - Compliance with privacy and data governance is maintained at all times.
