*** MAIN CONTENT CHUNKS ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### üîπ 1000 | KNOWLEDGE BASE ARCHITECTURE

The HIMKS Knowledge Base (KB) is a **modular, continuously updated, evidence-based library** that underpins all educational, explanatory, and reference content within the health & fitness system.

- **Core Features**:
    - All KB content is categorized by topic (exercise science, nutrition, sleep, recovery, motivation, injury prevention, behavior change, special populations, etc.).
    - Each module is versioned, date-stamped, and cross-linked with relevant system logic files.
    - Designed for accessibility and rapid retrieval by both AI logic and human users.

- **Layered Access**:
    - User: Receives phase-relevant, just-in-time explanations and guidance.
    - Coach: Accesses detailed references, advanced modules, and rationale for system decisions.
    - System: Leverages KB for all feedback, education, safety flags, and compliance prompts.

- **Audit & Update Mechanisms**:
    - All content reviewed annually or as new evidence emerges.
    - User and coach feedback loop for knowledge gaps or requested topics.

- **Transparency & Trust**:
    - Every system recommendation or feedback can cite specific KB entries and source references.
    - User-facing: ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù and ‚ÄúSee the science‚Äù links accompany advice and nudges.

#### üîπ 1010 | CURATION & EVIDENCE SOURCING

Curation is **grounded in current, peer-reviewed science and best practices**, with protocols for evaluating, updating, and flagging evidence.

- **Curation Protocol**:
    - Priority given to systematic reviews, meta-analyses, consensus statements (ACSM, WHO, IOC), and leading peer-reviewed journals.
    - Emerging science incorporated via a ‚Äúprovisional‚Äù layer, with ongoing review.
    - Outdated or disproven content is retired and marked as ‚Äúlegacy.‚Äù

- **Content Validation**:
    - Each KB entry includes source references (APA format), date of review, and evidence quality score (GRADE or similar).
    - Contradictory or evolving topics are noted with perspective summaries and current research debates.

- **Key Domains**:
    - Exercise programming (strength, cardio, flexibility, periodization)
    - Recovery (sleep, nutrition, mental health, active/passive recovery)
    - Injury/illness management and return-to-play
    - Special populations (pregnancy, elderly, chronic disease, youth)
    - Motivation, adherence, and behavioral psychology
    - Wearable/device integration and digital health

- **Research Review Board**:
    - System maintains or partners with a board of subject matter experts (SMEs) for quarterly audit and rapid update during new health events (e.g., COVID-19, new guidelines).

#### üîπ 1020 | EDUCATIONAL CONTENT & MICRO-LEARNING

KB powers **modular, user-specific, and phase-relevant education**‚Äîfrom quick tips to deep dives‚Äîdelivered at the point of need.

- **Content Types**:
    - **Micro-Lessons**: Short, actionable insights delivered during relevant moments (e.g., ‚ÄúWhy mobility matters before intensity,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat is HRV?‚Äù).
    - **Guides & FAQs**: In-depth modules for foundational topics, troubleshooting, and common questions.
    - **Interactive Media**: Videos, infographics, step-by-step checklists, animated demos.
    - **Behavioral Nudges**: Gentle prompts, ‚ÄúDid you know?‚Äù tips, and supportive reminders to reinforce learning and habits.

- **Personalization**:
    - Content adapts to user profile, phase, feedback, risk flags, and recent session history.
    - Dynamic ‚Äúlearning path‚Äù recommendations encourage progression from basics to advanced topics.
    - Self-assessment quizzes and knowledge checks unlock new content or suggest review.

- **Motivational & Reflective Prompts**:
    - Identity-based affirmations, mindset tools, and journaling exercises to foster adherence and internal motivation.
    - Case studies and stories for relatable, human-centered learning.

- **Accessibility & Inclusion**:
    - All modules available in multiple languages and formats (text, audio, visual).
    - Plain language summaries, visual cues, and dyslexia-friendly formatting as standard.

#### üîπ 1030 | INTEGRATION, SEARCH & USER INTERFACE

Ensures **seamless, context-aware integration** of KB with all HIMKS modules and user touchpoints.

- **System Integration**:
    - All modules (Session Engine, Recovery Stack, Compliance Engine, etc.) can pull tailored content in real time.
    - Adaptive notifications link KB insights to session cues, safety flags, and feedback prompts.

- **Search & Retrieval**:
    - Fast, full-text and keyword search; filterable by domain, user level, or current phase.
    - ‚ÄúSmart search‚Äù suggests related topics and follows up on common queries.

- **User Interface**:
    - In-app knowledge center with featured topics, search, FAQ, and personalized recommendations.
    - Contextual ‚Äúinfo icons‚Äù embedded throughout user interface (e.g., beside exercises, risk warnings, feedback forms).

- **Feedback Loop**:
    - Users can rate content, request clarifications, or suggest topics for future inclusion.
    - Coaches and admins can flag misinformation or outdated advice for rapid review.

- **Export & Reporting**:
    - Users can download or share KB articles for personal or allied health use.
    - Coaches access advanced content for further education or user coaching sessions.
