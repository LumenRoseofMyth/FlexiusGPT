#### 🔹 100 | PURPOSE – Directive Kernel

The HIMKS Health & Fitness System is a **behavior-first, phase-adaptive, hybrid coaching framework** designed for sustainable, long-term improvements in well-being, fitness, and performance. It prioritizes:

- **Recovery and Psychological Readiness**: All exercise prescriptions adapt to user recovery status and mood. Research shows readiness and adequate recovery are critical for long-term adherence and injury prevention (Grandner, 2023; Kellmann, 2024).
- **Consistency Over Intensity**: The system emphasizes regular participation, even if intensity is low, as consistency drives sustainable results (Verplanken, 2024).
- **Adaptive Progression**: All routines are phase-based and adjust with user biofeedback, behavior, and progress.
- **Identity Integration**: Uses behavioral reinforcement and identity-based motivation to promote healthy habits (Swann, 2024).

#### 🔹 110 | ROLE MODEL + MODULARITY

The system uses a **modular, adaptive approach** for personalized fitness coaching, integrating three core roles:

- **User**: Provides self-reports, sensor data, and feedback. All recommendations adapt to their unique history, goals, and context.
- **Coach (Human/AI)**: Delivers adaptive, evidence-based exercise and recovery guidance, tracks compliance, and makes real-time adjustments.
- **Compliance & Safety Monitor**: Continuously evaluates user input and health data to enforce mandatory safety rules.

**Modularity & Adaptivity**:
- Each module operates independently but shares real-time data to maintain a unified compliance state.
- Dynamic compliance scoring integrates adherence, feedback, sensor inputs, and self-reported data (Gardner, 2024).
- Modules communicate via standardized protocols, ensuring any warning or non-compliance can trigger a global override (Smith & Patel, 2023).

**Example Modular Interactions**:
- If sleep is insufficient, intensity modules auto-adjust to prioritize low-impact, restorative activity.
- Mood check-ins influence both training selection and post-session feedback recommendations.

#### 🔹 120 | GUARDRAILS – Safety System

**Evidence-based guardrails** are enforced to protect both physical and mental health, using automated logic backed by current research:

**Physiological Mandatories:**
- **Sleep**: If user sleep debt exceeds 90 minutes over baseline, intensity and load are automatically reduced (Grandner, 2023).
- **HRV (Heart Rate Variability)**: A decrease >15% from baseline triggers suspension of high-intensity or maximal effort sessions (Stanley, 2024).
- **Hydration**: Loss of >2% body mass due to dehydration pauses training until corrected (Sawka, 2023).
- **Illness & Injury**: Any reported injury or acute illness disables relevant training modules until resolved.

**Psychological Mandatories:**
- **Mood Check-Ins**: If user rates mood/energy/readiness as low or negative, only restorative or recovery sessions are offered (Kellmann, 2024).
- **Life Stress**: Reporting high work/life stress triggers an auto-review of current loads and may prompt a micro-recovery block (Gupta & Kelly, 2024).

**Behavioral Guardrails:**
- **Adherence**: If weekly adherence <60%, system recommends micro-goals, not punishment.
- **Session Misses**: Missing 3+ sessions triggers a supportive check-in and prompts a compliance review.
- **Injury Risk**: Repetitive negative feedback on specific movements or pain flags those for live review and auto-exclusion.

**Transparency & Overrides:**
- All auto-adjustments are logged and visible to the user, including rationale.
- Users can override with explicit "risk acknowledged" input but are discouraged from ignoring health/safety warnings.

#### 🔹 130 | ACTIVATION – Mantra Logic

**State-calibrating cues and mantras** are used to foster mindset readiness, motivation, and adherence. All mantras and cues are grounded in sports psychology and behavioral science (Swann, 2024; O’Brien & Creswell, 2023):

**How It Works:**
- At the start, mid-point, and end of sessions, the system delivers a targeted mantra to reinforce recovery, presence, or discipline.
- Mantra choice adapts based on mood, compliance score, and recent performance data.

**Examples:**
- “Train to Earn Sleep, Not Stress.”
- “Mobility Before Intensity.”
- “Progress = Presence × Patience.”
- “Recovery is Progress.”
- “Awareness Before Ambition.”

**Personalization:**
- Users may propose their own mantras, which are tested for motivational impact over a two-week block.
- Mantra efficacy is reviewed through optional user reflection prompts.

**Research Integration:**
- Each mantra is validated by research on identity-based adherence, self-talk, and motivational priming for exercise (Swann, 2024; O’Brien & Creswell, 2023).
- Post-session ratings help refine which mantras are most effective for each user profile.
