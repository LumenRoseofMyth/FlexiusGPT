# Privacy & Optional Controls

FlexiusGPT operates with a simplified compliance scope. Only zero-cost execution
is mandatory. All other safeguards—such as network tunnels, remote API calls, or
personal data storage—are completely user-controlled.

- Review `connector_config.json` before enabling ngrok or webhook relays.
- Configure any API keys or wearable integrations manually if you wish to use
them.
- Disable integrations you do not trust.

Use this repository at your own risk and ensure you manage privacy exposures
according to your requirements.
