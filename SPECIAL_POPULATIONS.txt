#### üîπ 1300 | SPECIAL POPULATION OVERVIEW

HIMKS supports **all users** through inclusive, customizable, and safety-validated programming. Special populations are defined as users whose needs, risks, or goals differ from the general population due to age, health, life events, or social context.

- **Population Groups Supported**:
    - Older adults (60+), youth/adolescents (‚â§17)
    - Pregnancy/postpartum
    - Chronic diseases: diabetes, CVD, hypertension, obesity, asthma, COPD
    - Musculoskeletal: arthritis, osteoporosis, joint replacement, back pain
    - Neurological: stroke, MS, Parkinson‚Äôs, CP, epilepsy
    - Mental health: depression, anxiety, trauma, eating disorders
    - Physical/intellectual disability
    - Athletes with high performance/adaptation needs
    - Return to activity post-injury/illness/surgery

- **Equity & Access**:
    - Interface, communication, and logic adapted for literacy, language, disability, culture, and socioeconomic context.
    - Promotes autonomy, dignity, and user choice at all levels.

- **Research & Safety**:
    - Programming and overrides adhere to ACSM, WHO, ADA, AHA, and clinical consensus guidelines.
    - Requires greater frequency of check-ins, more conservative progression, and lower risk tolerance.

#### üîπ 1310 | AGE-RELATED ADAPTATIONS

Programming is tailored by age to account for developmental and physiological differences.

- **Older Adults (60+)**:
    - Emphasis: balance, mobility, strength, power, functional independence (Fragala et al., 2019).
    - Intensity: Begin low-moderate; slow progression; daily activity encouraged.
    - Fall risk: Balance and proprioception training; environmental safety reviewed.
    - Medical review: Annual physician clearance, medication review, red-flag protocols.
    - Cognitive health: Incorporates dual-task, cognitive-motor exercises where possible.

- **Youth & Adolescents**:
    - Focus: movement skill acquisition, fun, positive social experience, confidence, age-appropriate strength (Faigenbaum et al., 2020).
    - Limitations: No maximal lifting pre-puberty; high volume or specialized sports discouraged.
    - Safeguards: Adult supervision, tailored education, growth plate injury monitoring.

- **Transition Periods**:
    - Puberty, menopause, andropause: education on hormonal, metabolic, and emotional changes; program adjustments for energy, mood, bone health.

- **Older & Younger: Universal Principles**:
    - Consistency > intensity, enjoyment, variety, and supportive social environment.
    - No one left behind‚Äîindividualization at every step.

#### üîπ 1320 | CHRONIC DISEASE & MEDICAL CONDITIONS

Outlines **adaptive logic and risk controls** for common medical scenarios.

- **Diabetes (Type 1 & 2)**:
    - Blood glucose checks pre/post-exercise (ADA, 2023).
    - Hypo/hyperglycemia risk: snack reminders, gradual intensity ramp, emergency contacts.
    - Encourages consistent aerobic + resistance; limits for neuropathy, retinopathy.

- **Cardiovascular Disease & Hypertension**:
    - Pre-screening mandatory; intensity capped (moderate); RPE and BP monitoring.
    - No Valsalva, abrupt load spikes, or unsupervised HIIT.
    - Immediate halt on chest pain, dizziness, abnormal symptoms.

- **Obesity & Metabolic Syndrome**:
    - Low-impact, progressive, non-judgmental programming; celebrates small wins.
    - Joint protection: aquatic, cycling, chair-based, or walking focus.

- **Pulmonary (Asthma/COPD)**:
    - Pre-exercise inhaler reminders, environmental controls (allergens, cold, pollution).
    - Gradual warm-up/cooldown, symptom monitoring, oxygen if prescribed.

- **Musculoskeletal & Neuro**:
    - Pain/injury-specific restrictions, progressive re-introduction of movement, functional goals.
    - PT/OT/physician input where relevant; regular progress review.

- **Cancer, Immune/Autoimmune**:
    - Fatigue and immune status monitored closely; flexible, symptom-adapted plans.
    - Hygiene and infection precautions for immunocompromised.

#### üîπ 1330 | LIFE EVENTS, ACCESS, & CULTURE

Addresses unique challenges, risks, and opportunities across **life transitions, access barriers, and cultural factors**.

- **Pregnancy/Postpartum**:
    - Follows ACOG, ACSM guidelines (ACOG, 2020).
    - Contraindications flagged: placenta previa, pre-eclampsia, persistent bleeding, high-risk conditions.
    - Emphasis on pelvic floor, core stability, low-impact aerobic, functional movement, and mental health support.
    - Postpartum: Gradual reintroduction, C-section/vaginal delivery consideration, breastfeeding guidance.

- **Socioeconomic & Access Barriers**:
    - All modules offer ‚Äúequipment-free,‚Äù low/no-cost, home-friendly options.
    - Nutrition and program logic adjust for food insecurity, shift work, caregiving, or travel.

- **Cultural & Religious Needs**:
    - Nutrition, scheduling, attire, and communication customized to cultural norms and preferences.
    - Content in multiple languages, holidays/sacred times respected, and culturally safe imagery.

- **Mental Health & Neurodiversity**:
    - Adaptive routines for mood, anxiety, ASD, ADHD.
    - Non-stigmatizing feedback; mental health support referrals if flagged.

- **Return to Activity**:
    - Post-surgery, illness, or major life event: phased return protocol; collaboration with medical/allied health.

- **Ongoing Review**:
    - All special population flags reviewed quarterly, or upon major health/life change.
