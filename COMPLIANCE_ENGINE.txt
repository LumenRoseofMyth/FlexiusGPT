#### üîπ 300 | COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

The HIMKS compliance engine is designed to **drive safe, sustainable habit formation and accountability** by continuously monitoring user inputs, contextual data, and behavioral patterns.

- **Core Objectives**:
    - Maximize adherence without coercion
    - Detect early warning signs for disengagement or overtraining
    - Provide real-time, actionable feedback for both users and coaches

- **Compliance Domains**:
    1. **Session Completion**: Tracks attendance and completion of planned sessions.
    2. **Self-Reporting**: Integrates mood, energy, pain, and motivation check-ins.
    3. **Sensor Integration**: Optionally uses HRV, sleep, step count, hydration, etc., from wearables.
    4. **Behavioral Trends**: Analyses historical adherence and attitude trends to inform guidance.

- **Guiding Principles**:
    - Compliance is never punitive; all interventions are constructive and solution-oriented (Gardner et al., 2020).
    - Transparency: Users see and understand their compliance score and triggers for interventions.
    - Adaptive: The system recalibrates compliance targets as user circumstances change (e.g., illness, life events).

#### üîπ 310 | DYNAMIC COMPLIANCE SCORING

**Compliance scoring** is multi-factor, adaptive, and personalized. It is recalculated daily and weekly, and directly informs session recommendations, progression, and safety overrides.

- **Scoring Algorithm**:
    - **Session Adherence**: % of scheduled sessions completed (weight: 40%).
    - **Self-Report Consistency**: Frequency and honesty in self-report check-ins (weight: 20%).
    - **Biofeedback Quality**: Sleep, HRV, step count, hydration status, if available (weight: 20%).
    - **Mood & Readiness**: Subjective ratings (weight: 10%).
    - **Feedback Quality**: Post-session feedback and pain/injury reporting (weight: 10%).

    *Total Score: Weighted sum, normalized to 0‚Äì100.*

- **Scoring Windows**:
    - **Daily**: Quick feedback, minor session-to-session course corrections.
    - **Weekly**: Triggers for phase changes, guardrails, or educational interventions.
    - **Monthly**: Trends inform long-term adjustments, habit focus, or support escalation.

- **Risk Tiers**:
    - **Green (80‚Äì100)**: Full access to all training features.
    - **Yellow (60‚Äì79)**: Suggest adaptive changes (lower volume, more recovery).
    - **Orange (40‚Äì59)**: Enforced focus on low-risk, recovery, and motivational education.
    - **Red (<40)**: Temporary pause, review compliance report, and initiate re-engagement protocol.

- **Research Basis**:
    - Dynamic, multi-input adherence models (O'Brien & Creswell, 2023; Gardner et al., 2020)
    - Integration of digital health biofeedback for personalization (Smith & Patel, 2023)

#### üîπ 320 | FEEDBACK & REINFORCEMENT LOGIC

Defines how the system **responds to compliance states**, ensuring motivation, habit formation, and learning remain positive and evidence-based.

- **Real-Time Feedback**:
    - Immediate, non-judgmental prompts following missed sessions, late check-ins, or low scores.
    - Examples: ‚ÄúMissed a session? Let‚Äôs adjust your plan together‚Äîevery step counts!‚Äù or ‚ÄúGreat streak! Ready to build on your progress?‚Äù

- **Reinforcement Techniques**:
    - **Positive Reinforcement**: Celebrate small wins, streaks, and progress milestones (Verplanken, 2024).
    - **Micro-Goaling**: If adherence slips, system shifts focus to easily achievable targets for quick wins (Gardner, 2020).
    - **Behavioral Prompts**: Suggest time, place, and cues for next session based on successful habit loops.
    - **Gamification Elements**: Optional badges, streak counters, ‚Äúlevel-up‚Äù mechanics.

- **Non-Punitive Correction**:
    - Reframe missed targets as learning opportunities, not failures.
    - Deliver ‚Äúif-then‚Äù implementation intentions (e.g., ‚ÄúIf I miss a session, I will‚Ä¶‚Äù) based on user profile and feedback.

- **Educational Interventions**:
    - Deliver bite-size content: ‚ÄúWhy recovery matters,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe science of consistency,‚Äù etc.
    - Link feedback to the science supporting each intervention (Swann, 2024).

- **User Empowerment**:
    - Allow user input on compliance metric weighting and preferred feedback style (supportive, neutral, performance-focused).

#### üîπ 330 | COMPLIANCE AUDIT & TRANSPARENCY

Ensures full **auditability, user trust, and ethical use of compliance data** throughout the health and fitness journey.

- **Audit Trail**:
    - All interventions, auto-adjustments, and user overrides are timestamped and logged.
    - Users can access a compliance history dashboard (weekly/monthly summaries, event logs, override reasons).

- **Privacy & Consent**:
    - User data is encrypted and used solely for adaptive feedback, unless user opts into aggregate research.
    - Compliance engine never shares individual health data outside system boundaries without explicit consent.

- **Transparency Protocols**:
    - All scoring formulas, weights, and rationale for interventions are visible to the user.
    - When an auto-override or guardrail is triggered, user receives an explanation and options for review or override (with risk acknowledgment).

- **Reporting**:
    - Coaches (if enabled) can access compliance reports to deliver human check-ins or motivational calls.
    - Users can export their compliance data for personal records or to share with allied health professionals.

- **Continuous Improvement**:
    - Feedback on the compliance system is actively solicited for ongoing refinement.
    - Regular reviews benchmark system interventions against new research (Gardner, 2024).
