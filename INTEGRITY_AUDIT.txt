#### üîπ 1600 | INTEGRITY MONITORING FRAMEWORK

The HIMKS Integrity Audit Engine is a **modular, real-time, and retrospective monitoring system** ensuring system-wide safety, ethical compliance, user trust, and accuracy.

- **Core Objectives**:
    - Identify, flag, and address anomalies, errors, or ethical risks in real time
    - Support transparency and accountability for all automated and human interventions
    - Provide auditable, timestamped logs for all critical user- and system-facing actions

- **Integrity Monitors**:
    - Continuous checks: session anomalies, override frequency, device data gaps, suspicious patterns
    - Retrospective audits: randomized review of compliance, coaching, safety, and user feedback logs

- **Multi-Level Triggers**:
    - Routine (auto-resolved): minor data entry mistakes, missed check-ins, low-risk device errors
    - Escalation (requires review): repeated overrides, risk protocol breaches, user complaints, major data inconsistencies

- **Frequency**:
    - Continuous automated monitoring for core metrics
    - Human/admin review: weekly, monthly, and as needed (post-incident or on request)

- **Audit Trail**:
    - All reviews and interventions fully timestamped, user-visible where appropriate, and protected under privacy policy

#### üîπ 1610 | DATA ACCURACY & TRACEABILITY

Outlines the logic and protocols for ensuring **data integrity, provenance, and correction** across all HIMKS modules.

- **Source Tracking**:
    - Every data point (user entry, device sync, manual override) tagged with timestamp, origin, and user/device ID
    - Edits and corrections recorded as versioned updates (never destructive)

- **Quality Control**:
    - Automated screening for outlier or biologically implausible values (e.g., HR >220, negative steps)
    - User- and coach-facing prompts to confirm or correct flagged data

- **Cross-Module Consistency**:
    - All modules (Session, Nutrition, Compliance, Recovery, Coaching, Device) regularly cross-reference for consistency
    - Integrity ‚Äúheartbeat‚Äù checks ensure no desync or drift between modules

- **Correction Protocols**:
    - Users and coaches can flag, edit, or annotate any data point; system logs all edits with rationale and role
    - If critical error, user is notified and may request rapid review

- **Data Retention**:
    - All original, corrected, and annotated data retained in secure, versioned storage for legal and research audit

#### üîπ 1620 | INCIDENT DETECTION & ESCALATION

Describes protocols for **detection, escalation, investigation, and resolution** of all system- and user-facing incidents.

- **Incident Types**:
    - Data anomalies: gaps, corrupt records, time shifts, duplicate entries
    - System failures: downtime, logic errors, unresponsive modules
    - Safety/ethics: override abuse, unapproved advice, privacy or consent violations, user complaints

- **Detection Logic**:
    - Automated anomaly detection with thresholds for frequency, timing, context
    - User reporting: instant ‚ÄúReport Issue‚Äù feature embedded throughout interface
    - Peer/coach review: escalated from frontline support or automated flags

- **Escalation Steps**:
    - Routine: auto-resolved with prompt to user/coach, logged for audit
    - Priority: escalated to HIMKS integrity team; incident assigned a unique tracking ID, all actions logged
    - Crisis: triggers immediate freeze of affected module, user notification, external review if risk to user safety

- **Resolution Protocols**:
    - Full documentation: incident, triggers, impact, root cause, fix, preventive measures
    - User feedback: invited after incident closure; satisfaction tracked

- **Continuous Improvement**:
    - Monthly incident reviews; system learning applied to reduce recurrence
    - External audits as required by law or in case of critical event

#### üîπ 1630 | USER RIGHTS, TRANSPARENCY & REPORTING

Ensures **user empowerment, visibility, and control** throughout the integrity and audit process.

- **Transparency**:
    - All users can view their own full audit trail: interventions, overrides, data edits, incident resolutions
    - Critical incidents: proactive user notification with details and next steps

- **User Control**:
    - Users may challenge or request review of any audit log or system decision
    - Option to export full personal data and audit history at any time

- **Appeal & Recourse**:
    - Direct, in-app pathway to appeal or escalate unresolved integrity issues to HIMKS support/admin
    - Escalated issues tracked with progress notifications to user

- **Ethics & Privacy**:
    - All audit actions comply with GDPR, HIPAA, and relevant global standards
    - User identity and sensitive data protected throughout; no sharing without explicit consent

- **Reporting & Metrics**:
    - Aggregated, anonymized integrity metrics published to user and coach community quarterly
    - Integrity audit history used to inform ongoing system improvement and user trust
