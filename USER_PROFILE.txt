#### üîπ 700 | INITIAL USER ASSESSMENT

Every HIMKS user journey begins with a **comprehensive intake and baseline assessment** to ensure programs are safe, relevant, and personalized from the outset.

- **Assessment Domains**:
    - **Demographics**: Age, biological sex, occupation, contact details (as permitted by privacy policy).
    - **Medical History**: Chronic diseases, musculoskeletal injuries, medication, allergies, surgery, family history (ACSM, 2022).
    - **Current Health Status**: Vital signs, basic anthropometrics (height, weight, BMI, body comp if available).
    - **Lifestyle**: Sleep patterns, stress level, occupation activity level, nutrition habits, tobacco/alcohol use.
    - **Physical Fitness**: Baseline movement screen, flexibility, cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength/endurance, balance.
    - **Psychological Readiness**: Motivation, goals, prior training experience, attitude toward exercise, perceived barriers (Kellmann, 2024).
    - **Technology Use**: Wearables, smartphone/desktop preference, data-sharing comfort.

- **Risk Screening**:
    - Follows established pre-participation screening protocols (PAR-Q+, ACSM, 2022).
    - Flags for physician clearance, contraindications, or adaptive programming.

- **Goal Clarification**:
    - Short- and long-term goal capture: health, weight, performance, lifestyle, mental well-being, rehab.
    - User ranks importance and perceived achievability.

#### üîπ 710 | PROFILE DATA DOMAINS & LIFECYCLE

Describes the **structure, evolution, and utilization of user data** in the system‚Äîsupporting real-time adaptivity and precision programming.

- **Profile Layers**:
    - **Static**: Baseline data‚Äîdemographics, medical history, major injury.
    - **Dynamic**: Ongoing metrics‚Äîadherence, performance, recovery, mood, feedback, incident reports.

- **Lifecycle Events**:
    - Intake ‚Üí periodic re-assessment (every 1‚Äì6 months, or after key milestones/injuries) ‚Üí continuous daily/weekly updates.

- **Key Dynamic Metrics**:
    - Sleep, HRV, resting heart rate, pain, hydration, session RPE, mood, compliance, dietary feedback, wearable metrics.
    - Event flags: missed sessions, phase changes, manual overrides, health events.

- **Data Use Cases**:
    - Drive adaptive programming, safety overrides, compliance scoring, and personalized feedback.
    - Enable detailed reporting for users, coaches, and allied health professionals.

- **User Engagement**:
    - Users prompted to update dynamic fields regularly; high friction minimized.
    - System uses micro-interactions and reminders to keep data current and meaningful.

#### üîπ 720 | RISK STRATIFICATION & SPECIAL POPULATIONS

System incorporates **risk stratification logic and tailored support for diverse populations** to maximize safety and equity.

- **Stratification Algorithm**:
    - Combines initial risk assessment, ongoing data, and event history to classify user as:
        1. Low risk (no chronic conditions, <45y, no symptoms)
        2. Moderate risk (chronic but stable, >45y, risk factors present)
        3. High risk (unstable chronic disease, symptoms, high falls risk, pregnancy, or injury)
    - Program restrictions and safety overrides scale accordingly (ACSM, 2022; Grandner, 2023).

- **Special Populations Supported**:
    - Older adults, youth/adolescents, pregnancy/postpartum, diabetes, hypertension, cardiac, orthopedic, neurological, mental health, obesity, athletes, and those returning from injury/illness.

- **Adaptive Programming**:
    - Each flag triggers module-specific protocols (e.g., lower starting load, referral to live coach, additional education).

- **Automated Alerts**:
    - Red-flag events (syncope, chest pain, severe pain, new symptoms) trigger emergency response and physician notification protocols.

- **Manual Review**:
    - Users or coaches may request manual profile update or additional assessment at any time.

#### üîπ 730 | PRIVACY, CONSENT & DATA GOVERNANCE

All HIMKS profiling is conducted with the **highest standards of privacy, informed consent, and ethical data management**, in full compliance with global health data guidelines.

- **Consent Protocols**:
    - Explicit, informed user consent for every data domain.
    - Clear explanation of data uses, sharing, retention, and user rights.

- **Data Security**:
    - All personal and health data encrypted in transit and at rest.
    - Strict access controls, audit logs, and optional anonymization for research.

- **User Control**:
    - Users can view, edit, download, or delete their profile at any time.
    - Sharing to coaches or external health professionals is opt-in only.

- **Transparency & Compliance**:
    - All logic regarding risk, program adaptation, and overrides visible to user.
    - Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and relevant local standards.

- **Data Use for Research**:
    - Aggregate, de-identified data may be used to improve system with user opt-in only.
    - No individual health data shared externally without explicit written permission.

- **Education**:
    - Users receive ongoing education on digital health privacy and safe data practices.
