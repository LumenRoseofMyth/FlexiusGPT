#### üîπ 1200 | MOTIVATION SCIENCE & SYSTEM DESIGN

The HIMKS Motivation Stack is based on a **multi-layered, evidence-based model** that views motivation as both a dynamic process and a skill to be developed.

- **Theoretical Foundations**:
    - Self-Determination Theory (autonomy, competence, relatedness) is primary (Ryan & Deci, 2023).
    - Identity-based motivation: users are encouraged to see themselves as ‚Äúsomeone who moves,‚Äù ‚Äúan active person,‚Äù or ‚Äúan athlete in progress‚Äù (Swann et al., 2024).
    - Growth mindset and positive psychology‚Äîfocus on progress, not perfection (Dweck, 2023).

- **Motivation Dynamics**:
    - Recognizes motivation fluctuates; system is built to scaffold users through low periods, celebrate wins, and normalize setbacks.
    - Uses both extrinsic (badges, streaks, feedback) and intrinsic (meaning, mastery, identity) drivers.

- **Integration with Phases and Personalization**:
    - Motivation content, cues, and nudges are phase- and profile-matched.
    - Users select preferred motivation style: ‚Äúsoft support,‚Äù ‚Äúperformance push,‚Äù or ‚Äúscience & logic.‚Äù

- **Measurement & Feedback**:
    - Ongoing mood/motivation check-ins, self-efficacy scaling, goal importance and readiness.
    - Tracks motivational trends over time and correlates with adherence.

#### üîπ 1210 | MOTIVATIONAL TRIGGERS & LOGIC

Specifies how the system **detects, anticipates, and intervenes** to support user motivation throughout the journey.

- **Trigger Events**:
    - Session misses, streak breaks, compliance dips, reported low mood, risk flag triggers.
    - Positive: milestones, PBs, streaks, phase completions, user milestones (e.g., ‚Äúfirst 10 sessions‚Äù).

- **Motivational Interventions**:
    - **Real-Time Nudges**: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve missed two sessions‚Äîremember why you started!‚Äù ‚ÄúConsistency matters more than intensity.‚Äù
    - **Reflection Prompts**: ‚ÄúWhat made today‚Äôs session challenging?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can you set yourself up for success tomorrow?‚Äù
    - **Goal Reframing**: Automatic rephrasing of goals from outcome-based (‚Äúlose 5kg‚Äù) to behavior-based (‚Äúmove 20 min every day‚Äù).
    - **Mindset Cues**: Reminders of growth, effort, and resilience (‚ÄúProgress = presence √ó patience.‚Äù).
    - **Value Clarification**: Prompts users to revisit why their goals matter to them and who benefits.

- **Adaptive Delivery**:
    - Intensity and frequency of nudges scale with user engagement, history, and preferences.
    - ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù and ‚ÄúQuiet Mode‚Äù options for burnout or stress.

- **Crisis Support**:
    - Persistent negative mood or motivational collapse triggers referral to educational or mental health support, and/or escalation to human coach.

#### üîπ 1220 | HABIT FORMATION & SUSTAINABILITY

Focuses on translating **motivation into sustainable, automatic behaviors**‚Äîthe core of lifelong health change.

- **Habit Loop Integration**:
    - Every goal and session is connected to a ‚Äúcue-routine-reward‚Äù loop (Duhigg, 2023).
    - Cues: Scheduled notifications, time-based prompts, environment design (leaving shoes out, prepping gym bag).
    - Routine: Clearly defined, achievable actions (short sessions, ‚Äúmicro-habits,‚Äù mobility break).
    - Reward: Immediate feedback (celebration, streaks, post-session positive reflection).

- **Micro-Goals & Streaks**:
    - Users set micro-goals‚Äîsmall, repeatable actions (e.g., ‚Äúwalk 10 min after lunch‚Äù)‚Äîwith instant feedback and celebration on completion.
    - System tracks streaks, not just absolute progress.

- **Implementation Intentions**:
    - System helps users set ‚Äúif‚Äìthen‚Äù plans (‚ÄúIf I miss a morning session, then I‚Äôll move after work‚Äù).
    - Regular reviews and suggested edits based on adherence and changing circumstances.

- **Barriers & Problem-Solving**:
    - Weekly self-review: ‚ÄúWhat got in the way this week?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow will I handle that next time?‚Äù
    - Adaptive, supportive education modules on time management, motivation, and overcoming obstacles.

- **Automaticity Tracking**:
    - Monitors how long a user maintains behaviors and identifies when habits become automatic (Lally et al., 2010).

#### üîπ 1230 | GAMIFICATION, SOCIAL & FEEDBACK

Leverages **gamification and social engagement** to boost adherence and fun‚Äîwhile reinforcing internal motivation.

- **Gamification Features**:
    - Badges, points, and levels for consistency, milestones, and achievements.
    - Leaderboards (opt-in, privacy-protected), self-competition (‚Äúbeat your best week‚Äù), and ‚Äúquest‚Äù challenges.

- **Social & Peer Support**:
    - Optional buddy system, accountability partner, or team features.
    - Positive reinforcement from peers, group challenges, and community support for shared goals.

- **Public & Private Recognition**:
    - Users can share achievements or keep them private; sharing is always opt-in.
    - Public boards highlight diverse progress stories (variety of abilities and backgrounds).

- **Feedback Loop**:
    - Regular prompts for users to reflect on progress, effort, and barriers overcome.
    - Feedback from the system is always positive, non-punitive, and solution-focused.

- **Continuous Learning**:
    - Adaptive education: ‚ÄúHow motivation works,‚Äù ‚ÄúMastering the habit loop,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe psychology of streaks.‚Äù
    - Micro-polls and self-rating of motivation interventions for ongoing refinement.
