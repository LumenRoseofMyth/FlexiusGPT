#### üîπ 1800 | ACCESSIBILITY PHILOSOPHY & FRAMEWORK

The HIMKS Accessibility Engine is built on the principle that **fitness, health, and digital empowerment are universal rights** (WHO, 2022).

- **Core Philosophy**:
    - Accessibility is foundational: ‚Äúno one left behind.‚Äù
    - Proactive design for users with disabilities, chronic health conditions, low literacy, or language barriers.
    - Universal usability and enjoyment, not just compliance.

- **Legal and Ethical Frameworks**:
    - Adheres to WCAG 2.2 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), ADA, EN 301 549, Section 508, and local/global digital health regulations.
    - Co-designed and audited with people of lived experience of disability and neurodiversity.

- **Scope**:
    - Covers all digital interfaces, communication, educational content, physical activity protocols, and device integrations.

- **Transparency & User Empowerment**:
    - Accessibility features, rationale, and support always visible and modifiable by the user.
    - Commitment to transparency, user education, and recourse.

#### üîπ 1810 | MULTI-MODALITY & UNIVERSAL DESIGN

Outlines the **multi-modal and universal design principles** that enable full participation for all users.

- **Interface Design**:
    - Responsive design: mobile, tablet, desktop, screen readers, voice assistants.
    - High-contrast themes, scalable font sizes, dyslexia-friendly fonts, simple layouts.
    - Keyboard and switch navigation, large touch targets, ‚Äúskip to main content‚Äù feature.

- **Alternative Formats**:
    - All content available as text, audio, and visual (captions/subtitles on all videos, alt text for all images).
    - Interactive elements (quizzes, forms) accessible via screen reader and keyboard.
    - Sensory-friendly design: no flashing, low-sensory options, sound/motion reduction toggles.

- **Physical Accessibility**:
    - All recommended exercise protocols include seated/chair, standing, and lying modifications.
    - Adaptive movement guides for wheelchair users, prosthetic users, or people with chronic pain.
    - Activity modules avoid exclusionary language and provide options for any ability level.

#### üîπ 1820 | LANGUAGE, LITERACY & INCLUSION

Ensures **full accessibility across languages, literacy levels, and cultural backgrounds**.

- **Language Access**:
    - All modules, education, and UI in multiple languages (with community feedback for clarity).
    - On-demand machine and human translation options.
    - Real-time captioning for live events, chat, and support.

- **Literacy Adaptation**:
    - Plain language summaries, visual cues, step-by-step pictograms for instructions.
    - Glossaries and ‚Äúdefine this‚Äù buttons for medical/technical terms.
    - Option for narrated guidance and audio explanations.

- **Cultural & Contextual Inclusion**:
    - Culturally respectful imagery, attire, and dietary/nutrition guidance.
    - Sensitive to religious, gender, and social norms‚Äîcustomizable by user.

- **Cognitive & Neurodiversity**:
    - Visual schedules, task checklists, focus aids for users with ADHD, ASD, or learning disabilities.
    - Customizable pace, color-coding, and interface layout.
    - Calm mode and distraction reduction options.

#### üîπ 1830 | MONITORING, FEEDBACK & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

Describes **monitoring, user feedback, and improvement cycles** to maintain and expand accessibility.

- **Accessibility Audits**:
    - Automated and manual accessibility testing quarterly.
    - Community beta testers with disabilities/neurodiversity for all new features.
    - Rapid response to flagged accessibility barriers.

- **User Feedback & Recourse**:
    - ‚ÄúReport accessibility issue‚Äù available on every page and feature.
    - All feedback triaged within 48 hours; critical access issues prioritized.
    - Option for live human support (text, audio, video, language interpreter).

- **Continuous Learning**:
    - User education on available accessibility features.
    - Staff and coach training on accessibility, inclusion, and bias reduction.
    - Ongoing consultation with accessibility SMEs and advocacy organizations.

- **Transparency & Accountability**:
