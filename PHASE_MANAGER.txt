#### 🔹 200 | PHASE ARCHITECTURE

The HIMKS system operates on a **multi-phase cycle**, with each phase rooted in evidence-based training theory and designed to optimize health, adaptation, and motivation. Phases can be auto-selected or user-directed, and always consider the latest biofeedback and psychological state.

- **Core Phases**:
    1. **Foundation Phase**: Focus on movement quality, stability, aerobic conditioning, and habit formation. Duration: 2–6 weeks.
    2. **Progression Phase**: Introduces progressive overload, higher intensity, and volume. Duration: 4–8 weeks.
    3. **Peak/Performance Phase**: Short cycle for targeted performance or aesthetic goals; includes the highest intensity and load. Duration: 2–4 weeks.
    4. **Recovery/Regeneration Phase**: Active deload for restoration and mental reset. Includes structured mobility, low-intensity cardio, and mindfulness. Duration: 1–3 weeks.
    5. **Specialty/Microcycle**: Short phases for skill acquisition, correction of imbalances, or lifestyle events.

- **Research Basis**:
    - Periodization models (Harries, Lubans, & Callister, 2015; Lorenz et al., 2017)
    - Habit formation theory (Gardner et al., 2020)
    - Recovery cycling (Kellmann, 2024)

- **Adaptive Criteria**:
    - Phase selection is based on compliance score, biofeedback (HRV, sleep, hydration), psychological readiness, injury risk, and user preference.
    - System auto-adjusts duration and content of each phase in response to ongoing input.

#### 🔹 210 | PHASE PROGRESSION & TRANSITIONS

Each phase contains its own **entry, progression, and exit logic** governed by user data, feedback, and research-backed triggers.

- **Phase Entry**:
    - Automatic or manual, triggered by meeting phase objectives or guardrail events (e.g., sleep debt, low mood).
    - User can request early exit or delay via compliance override (with feedback).

- **Progression Logic**:
    - **Foundation to Progression**: Minimum compliance of 75% for baseline activities (movement, aerobic) over 2–4 weeks; no injury or negative mood flags.
    - **Progression to Peak**: Sustained improvement (volume, intensity, technique), recovery readiness, positive feedback, and adherence ≥80%.
    - **Peak to Recovery**: Auto-triggered after 2–4 weeks or if recovery metrics fall (HRV, sleep, mood); may also be user-driven.
    - **Recovery to Foundation/Progression**: Completed restoration (subjective and objective measures), re-established baseline, and readiness confirmed.

- **Transition Management**:
    - Every transition includes a short review of progress, adherence, and injury/pain feedback.
    - System provides summary report and new phase orientation, including revised goals, risk factors, and personalized focus.

- **Specialty Phases**:
    - Activated for specific needs: rehab, travel, time constraints, new skill focus.
    - Can override main phases for up to 2 weeks, then auto-review.

#### 🔹 220 | PHASE FAILSAFES & OVERRIDES

A robust **failsafe and override system** is integrated to protect user safety and long-term adaptation.

- **Automatic Pausing/Regressing**:
    - Severe negative trends (e.g., HRV >20% drop, sleep <6h for 3 days, persistent negative mood, pain reports) cause phase regression or full pause.
    - Missed sessions: 3+ missed in a row → mandatory microcycle review.

- **Manual Override**:
    - Users may request phase changes, but system prompts risk review and logs rationale.
    - Certain guardrails (e.g., injury/illness) cannot be overridden without explicit risk acknowledgment and supporting reason.

- **Recovery Defaults**:
    - If in doubt, the system always defaults to recovery/mobility phase (Grandner, 2023).
    - Re-entry into higher phases only after meeting minimum recovery/health criteria.

- **Audit & Compliance**:
    - All overrides, pauses, and regressions are logged and summarized for user transparency.
    - Repeated overrides trigger additional review and education modules.

- **AI-Assisted Check-ins**:
    - Optional, but recommended: Weekly or phase-end check-ins by a coach (AI/human) to review phase effectiveness, user well-being, and readiness for transition.

#### 🔹 230 | PHASE-SPECIFIC PRESCRIPTIONS

Each phase is supported by specific, research-aligned training, recovery, and lifestyle recommendations:

- **Foundation Phase**:
    - Focus: Movement literacy, aerobic base, neuromuscular control, consistency.
    - Prescription: 2–4 full-body sessions/week, daily mobility, zone 2 cardio, education on form/breathing.
    - Feedback: Regular self-assessment, compliance check, foundational movement tests.

- **Progression Phase**:
    - Focus: Progressive resistance, intensity/volume increases, movement variety.
    - Prescription: 3–5 sessions/week, strength supersets, moderate-high intensity intervals, gradual overload.
    - Feedback: Session RPE (rate of perceived exertion), adherence tracking, weekly progress review.

- **Peak/Performance Phase**:
    - Focus: Specific goal achievement (performance/aesthetic), highest controlled intensity.
    - Prescription: 3–5 targeted sessions/week, advanced lifts, speed/power circuits, deload at phase end.
    - Safeguards: Injury/mood/sleep checks at each session, mandatory deload after peak.

- **Recovery/Regeneration Phase**:
    - Focus: Full restoration of CNS, connective tissue, mental well-being.
    - Prescription: Low-impact activity (walking, yoga, swimming), sleep optimization, mindfulness, breathing drills.
    - Feedback: Mood and recovery check-ins, exit criteria based on energy and readiness.

- **Specialty/Microcycle**:
    - Focus: Custom (e.g., skill acquisition, rehab, maintenance during travel).
    - Prescription: Highly individualized, often lower volume, targeted focus.
    - Feedback: Short duration, specific goal checks, rapid return to main phase.

- **Adaptive Recommendations**:
    - All prescriptions are modifiable based on biofeedback and self-report.
    - Nutrition, hydration, and sleep hygiene guidance layered into each phase as needed.
